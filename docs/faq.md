# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
## PKT PLTB Archimedes Spiral Wind Turbine

## General Questions

### What is an Archimedes Spiral wind turbine?
The Archimedes Spiral wind turbine is an innovative wind energy device that uses a conical spiral blade design based on the ancient Archimedean screw principle. Unlike traditional propeller-style turbines, it features a helical design that offers improved efficiency, lower noise, and better performance in varying wind conditions.

### How is it different from traditional wind turbines?
Key differences include:
- Conical spiral design vs. propeller blades
- Omnidirectional wind capture
- Lower cut-in wind speed (2 m/s vs. 3-4 m/s)
- Quieter operation (40-45 dB vs. 55-65 dB)
- Safer for wildlife
- Better suited for urban environments
- Lower maintenance requirements

### Who invented this technology?
The technology is based on the Archimedean screw principle, discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes over 2,000 years ago. Modern applications for wind energy were developed in the Netherlands in the early 2000s, and PKT has adapted and enhanced the design for the Indonesian market with the 2026 model series.

## Technical Questions

### What wind speed is needed for the turbine to work?
The PKT-AS-2026 series starts generating power at wind speeds as low as 2 m/s (7.2 km/h). Rated power output is achieved at 7-9 m/s depending on the model. The turbine automatically shuts down (brakes) at wind speeds above 25-35 m/s to protect the system.

### How much electricity can it generate?
This depends on the model and your local wind conditions:
- **Small (S)**: 2,000-3,500 kWh/year
- **Medium (M)**: 4,500-7,500 kWh/year
- **Large (L)**: 15,000-28,000 kWh/year

For reference, an average Indonesian home uses 300-500 kWh per month.

### How efficient is it?
The PKT-AS-2026 series achieves a power coefficient (Cp) of 0.42-0.47, which is competitive with the best small wind turbines on the market. In real-world conditions with variable wind speeds and directions, it typically outperforms traditional HAWTs by 25-35%.

### Can it work in low wind areas?
Yes! The low cut-in speed of 2 m/s means it can generate power in light winds that traditional turbines cannot capture. However, for economic viability, we recommend average wind speeds of at least 4 m/s at your installation height.

### How loud is it?
Very quiet! Noise levels are:
- Small model: <40 dB at 10m (quieter than a library)
- Medium model: <42 dB at 10m (quieter than a refrigerator)
- Large model: <45 dB at 10m (quieter than normal conversation)

You won't hear it from inside your home.

### Does it need to point into the wind?
No! That's one of the major advantages. The spiral design captures wind from any direction, so no yaw mechanism is needed. This makes it more reliable and reduces maintenance.
